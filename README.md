# COVID-Testing
This repository provides a free, readily modifed and deployable standards based web page for the
COVID Rural Testing &amp; Tracing Toolkit (RT3).

## About
[VashonBePrepared](https://VashonBePrepared.org) is the FEMA recognized Citizen Corps Council for rural 
Vashon Island in the Salish Sea. It is a coalition of many volunteer 
organizations - who do the real work!

Vashon's [Medical Reeserve Corps (MRC)](https://VashonBePrepared.org/MRC) is a model project that is fighting the 
COVID Pandemic on numerous fronts. 

## RT3 - Rural Testing & Tracing Toolkit
One of these is the 
[COVID Rural Testing &amp; Tracing Toolkit (RT3)](https://VashonBePrepared.org/Testing), 
that provides rural communities a proven 
toolkit for conducting their own COVID testing for local residents outside a 
formal hospital setting.

Vashon's MRC is making freely available their pioneering simple, no frills COVID-19 testing set-up that 
follows CDC guidence and can still be run by volunteers with proper training.

We are making this available to other communities around the world as a model. Learn 
more at www.VashonBePrepared.org/Testing

Within this larger context above, this particular GitHub repository, at www.github.com/EOCOnline/Covid-Testing,
provides a standards based, easily replicated web page that can be integrated into your 
existing website, and easily branded to assure your visitors.

## Roadmap
The goal is to create three independent versions:
1. CovidTesting.htm & css/CovidTesting.css provide a single web page with some rudimentary styles including pictures so 
it could stand alone as a website, or sub-domain.
2. CovidTestingPlain.htm & css/CovidTestingPlain.css provides a single web page with minimal styling 
and one image, so that it can be included into an existing website as a new page.
3. CovidTestingBare.htm & css/CovidTestingBare.css provides a single web page with no styling 
and no graphics, so that it can be included into an existing website as a new page.

Other goals:
- [x] Create a basic page using only jQuery & Bootstrap
- [ ] Create the other two pages
- [ ] Distribute a basic Google Form for providers to request a patient get tested

Please list you issues or additional goals in the 2nd tab above labelled "Issues".
