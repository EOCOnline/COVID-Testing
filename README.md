# COVID-Testing
Standards based simple web page for COVID testing advice &amp; scheduling

VashonBePrepared.org pioneered a simple, no frills COVID-19 testing set-up that 
follows CDC guidence and can still be run by volunteers with proper training.

We are making this available to other communities around the world as a model.

Within this larger context, this particular site, at www.github.com/eoconline/Covid-Testing,
provides a standards based, easily replicated web page that can be integrated into your 
existing website, and easily branded to assure your visitors.

It is distributed with the very lenient MIT license: just retain the Copyright to 
acknowledge where it came from and you can make changes as you see fit.
