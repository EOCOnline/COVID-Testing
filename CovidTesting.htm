            <h1>COVID-19 Testing</h1>
            <p class="lead">Why are we doing testing?</p>
            <p>Social distancing measures are critical to slowing the spread
                of the virus causing COVID-19 disease in our
                communities and keeping our healthcare system from being
                overwhelmed. Our community is particularly at risk
                because our clinics and 1st responders have limited capacity
                and there are many high-risk people living here.
                Many people in our area who have symptoms that could be
                caused by the Coronavirus do not have COVID-19.
                Therefore testing for the virus is an important component of
                controlling the COVID-19 pandemic because it allows
                public health efforts to be specifically focused on isolating
                and supporting infected individuals so they don’t
                pass it on to others.</p>

                <span class="A">
                    <div>Our COVID-19 Testing Project follows our County's Public Health
                        guidelines for who should be tested.
                        Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</div>

                    <div>Those at increased risk of disease are those who are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>60 years of age,</li>
                            <li>have underlying health conditions including diabetes, heart, lung or kidney disease,
                            </li>
                            <li>are Immunodeficient or</li>
                            <li>are pregnant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </span>

                <h3>WHAT TYPE OF TEST IS IT?</h3>

                <div>Our test is self-administered by patients. You will swab both
                    nostrils and place the swab in a vial for later testing.</div>

                <div>This test is different from what you may have seen at other
                    test sites in the news. It is similar to the
                    process used by <a href="https://SeattleFlu.org">SeattleFlu.org</a>
                    and <a href="https://PublicHealthSCAN.org">PublicHealthSCAN.org</a>
                    for COVID-19 testing and is FDA approved. Another
                    advantage of this strategy is that it can be readily expanded
                    as needed (and as testing supplies allow.)</div>

                <h4>HOW DO I GET TESTED?</h4>

                <div>If you have symptoms of COVID-19 talk to your healthcare
                    provider about whether you need a test. They can order
                    a test for you through this website.</div>

                <div>Make sure they have your name, birthdate, phone number and email address.</div>
                ‍
                <div>A volunteer will be contact you by phone at
                    the number your provider gives to us- please make
                    sure your provider has correct contact information.
                    The volunteer will confirm your contact information
                    including an emergency phone number, collect some
                    additional healthcare information from you and then email to
                    you an authorization for the test. You must bring
                    identification with you to the test site (driver's license,
                    passport, utility bill with your name).</div>

                <h4>WHAT IF I DON't HAVE A DOCTOR?</h4>

                <div>We can't be your doctor, but if you don't have a primary care
                    provider, we can help decide whether you should
                    be tested if you don't have a primary care provider.
                    If you have symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 and you
                    don't have a healthcare provider, please call our
                    testing team at (844) 469-4554.</div>

                    ask questions in English or Spanish.</div>

                <h4>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</h4>

                <div>The test costs $50 to conduct. You will be asked to provide
                    your insurance information and the company that
                    conducts the test will bill them. If you do not have
                    insurance or your insurance denies the claim,
                    xxxxxx will cover the cost of testing.</div>

                <h4>WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SAMPLE?</h4>

                <div>Your sample will be collected with others once a day
                    and shipped to a certified laboratory for testing. Our
                    goal is to get your result to you and your provider
                    as quickly as we can.</div>

                <h4>WHEN & HOW WILL I GET THE RESULTS?</h4>

                <div>We expect results back within 3-4 days although if
                    demand outstrips laboratory capacity, it may take
                    longer to get results. When we receive results a volunteer
                    will call you at the contact number(s) you provided prior
                    to the test. If this changes, please notify us by calling: (555) 100-000</div>

                <h4>WHAT IF MY TEST IS POSITIVE?</h4>

                <div>If your test is positive you have COVID-19 disease. It is
                    important that you contact your provider if you
                    experience any trouble breathing or if you still have a fever.
                    We will notify your provider, but cannot manage your
                    illness. You are also infectious for others so you must not
                    leave your home for 14 days from the onset of illness.
                    Guidance to protect others in your home from becoming
                    infected can be found at the Center for Disease Control
                    website. If you need assistance with food or supplies,
                    please let the volunteer who gives you your test result know.</div>

                <div>If you test positive we are obligated to inform
                    State Public Health officials. The volunteer who provides
                    your result will also ask you about your contacts in the
                    past week. We are doing this so we can let them know that
                    they have been exposed to someone with the virus and can
                    get them tested if they are experiencing symptoms. We will
                    not use your name in this inquiry. Tracking of contacts of
                    infected individuals is the best way to eliminate the
                    spread of COVID-19.</div>

                <h4>WHAT IF MY TEST IS NEGATIVE?</h4>

                <div>A negative test result does not necessarily mean that
                    you don’t have COVID-19 disease. A person with
                    COVID-19 can test negative for a variety of reasons including
                    testing performed very early in their disease and
                    problems obtaining an adequate sample from your nose. If you
                    test negative you should still self-isolate for at
                    least 72 hours after your symptoms disappear. If your test is
                    negative and you continue to have symptoms, or
                    symptoms worsen, you can be tested again.</div>

                <h4>HOW IS MY PRIVACY BEING PROTECTED?</h4>

                <div>Personal information provided to us will be kept
                    on a password protected secure server and will be used
                    only for the purpose of conducting this test. The result
                    of your test will be shared only with you and your
                    provider. If positive, we are required to also report
