    <h3>Why are we doing testing?</h3>
    <div>Social distancing measures are critical to slowing the spread
        of the virus causing COVID-19 disease in our
        communities and keeping our healthcare system from being
        overwhelmed. Vashon Island is particularly at risk
        because our clinics and 1st responders have limited capacity
        and there are many high-risk people living here.
        Many people in our area who have symptoms that could be
        caused by the Coronavirus do not have COVID-19.
        Therefore testing for the virus is an important component of
        controlling the COVID-19 pandemic because it allows
        public health efforts to be specifically focused on isolating
        and supporting infected individuals so they don’t
        pass it on to others.</div>

    <div>Realizing the importance of COVID-19 testing to Vashon’s overall
        response to the pandemic, VashonBePrepared
        developed and has now deployed a COVID-19 testing site on
        Vashon Island. We developed our testing strategy with
        the specific goals of making testing as safe as possible for
        our all-volunteer workforce and for those being
        tested, while conserving personal protective equipment
        for hospitals and clinics.</div>

                    of Covid-19, which are: fever, cough and

    <h3>Answers to Common Questions</h3>

    <h4>WHO SHOULD GET A TEST?</h4>

    <div>The Vashon COVID-19 Testing Project is following King County Public Health
        guidelines for who should be tested.
        Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</div>

    <div>Those at increased risk of disease are those who are:
        <ul>
            <li>60 years of age,</li>
            <li>have underlying health conditions including diabetes, heart, lung or kidney disease,</li>
            <li>are Immunodeficient or</li>
            <li>are pregnant.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>WHAT TYPE OF TEST IS IT?</h4>

    <div>Our test is self-administered by patients. You will swab both
        nostrils and place the swab in a vial for later testing.</div>

    <div>This test is different from what you may have seen at other
        test sites in the news. It is similar to the
        process used by <a href="https://SeattleFlu.org">SeattleFlu.org</a> 
        and <a href="https://PublicHealthSCAN.org">PublicHealthSCAN.org</a>
        for COVID-19 testing and is FDA approved. Another
        advantage of this strategy is that it can be readily expanded
        as needed (and as testing supplies allow.)</div>

    <h4>HOW DO I GET TESTED?</h4>

    <div>If you have symptoms of COVID-19 talk to your healthcare
        provider about whether you need a test. They can order
        a test for you through this website.</div>

    <div>Make sure they have your name, birthdate, phone number and email address.</div>
    ‍
    <div>A  volunteer will be contact you by phone at
        the number your provider gives to us- please make
        sure your provider has correct contact information.
        The volunteer will confirm your contact information
        including an emergency phone number, collect some
        additional healthcare information from you and then email to
        you an authorization for the test. You must bring
        identification with you to the test site (driver's license,
        passport, utility bill with your name).</div>

    <h4>WHAT IF I DON't HAVE A DOCTOR?</h4>

    <div>We can't be your doctor, but if you don't have a primary care
        provider, we can help decide whether you should
        be tested if you don't have a primary care provider.
        If you have symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 and you
        don't have a healthcare provider, please call our
        testing team at (844) 469-4554.</div>

    <div>A volunteer healthcare worker will talk to you and decide if a test is needed.</div>

    <div>If you are uncertain about what to do, email us at
        Questions@gmail.com or call (555) 100-000 to
        ask questions in English or Spanish.</div>

    <h4>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</h4>

    <div>The test costs $50 to conduct. You will be asked to provide
        your insurance information and the company that
        conducts the test will bill them. If you do not have
        insurance or your insurance denies the claim,
        xxxxxx will cover the cost of testing.</div>

    <h4>WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SAMPLE?</h4>

    <div>Your sample will be collected with others once a day
        and shipped to a certified laboratory for testing. Our
        goal is to get your result to you and your provider
        as quickly as we can.</div>

    <h4>WHEN & HOW WILL I GET THE RESULTS?</h4>

    <div>We expect results back within 3-4 days although if
        demand outstrips laboratory capacity, it may take
        longer to get results. When we receive results a volunteer
        will call you at the contact number(s) you provided prior
        to the test. If this changes, please notify us by calling: (555) 100-000</div>

    <h4>WHAT IF MY TEST IS POSITIVE?</h4>

    <div>If your test is positive you have COVID-19 disease. It is
        important that you contact your provider if you
        experience any trouble breathing or if you still have a fever.
        We will notify your provider, but cannot manage your
        illness. You are also infectious for others so you must not
        leave your home for 14 days from the onset of illness.
        Guidance to protect others in your home from becoming
        infected can be found at the Center for Disease Control
        website. If you need assistance with food or supplies,
        please let the volunteer who gives you your test result know.</div>

    <div>If you test positive we are obligated to inform
        State Public Health officials. The volunteer who provides
        your result will also ask you about your contacts in the
        past week. We are doing this so we can let them know that
        they have been exposed to someone with the virus and can
        get them tested if they are experiencing symptoms. We will
        not use your name in this inquiry. Tracking of contacts of
        infected individuals is the best way to eliminate the
        spread of COVID-19.</div>

    <h4>WHAT IF MY TEST IS NEGATIVE?</h4>

    <div>A negative test result does not necessarily mean that
        you don’t have COVID-19 disease. A person with
        COVID-19 can test negative for a variety of reasons including
        testing performed very early in their disease and
        problems obtaining an adequate sample from your nose. If you
        test negative you should still self-isolate for at
        least 72 hours after your symptoms disappear. If your test is
        negative and you continue to have symptoms, or
        symptoms worsen, you can be tested again.</div>

    <h4>HOW IS MY PRIVACY BEING PROTECTED?</h4>

    <div>Personal information provided to us will be kept
        on a password protected secure server and will be used
        only for the purpose of conducting this test. The result
        of your test will be shared only with you and your
        provider. If positive, we are required to also report
        the result to Public Health.</div>
